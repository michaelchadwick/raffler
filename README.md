# Raffler

Click or tap the button and a cavalcade of pre-loaded names will begin to cycle animatedly on your screen. After a rousing "beep-boop" chorus 
concludes, one name, and one name only, will be selected and highlighted. That name will then be put on The List and will not be chosen again if the 
Raffler is re-run (until rest, naturally).

Names go in /json/raffler-data.json.
